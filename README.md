#  Guess the State {Python Game}
A Python program that creates a game called "Guess the State". The game uses turtle and pandas modules to display a map of the U.S. and ask the user to guess the names of the 50 states. The game has the following features:

â€¢  It reads the data from a CSV file that contains the state names and their coordinates on the map.

â€¢  It uses a turtle object to draw the map image as the background of the screen.

â€¢  It uses a loop to prompt the user to enter a state name until they guess all 50 states or type "Exit".

â€¢  It checks if the user's input is a valid state name and if it has not been guessed before.

â€¢  If the user's input is correct, it uses another turtle object to write the state name on the map at the corresponding coordinates, and updates the title of the screen with the number of correct guesses.

â€¢  If the user's input is incorrect or repeated, it does nothing and asks for another input.

â€¢  If the user types "Exit", it breaks the loop and creates a new CSV file that contains the names of the states that the user did not guess, which can be used for learning.

## Tech Stack
The game "Guess the State" used the following technologies:

â€¢  Python: Python is a popular programming language that can be used for various purposes, such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and game development. You can learn more about Python from [this tutorial].

â€¢  Turtle: Turtle is a Python module that provides a graphical interface for drawing shapes and animations using a virtual turtle. The game used turtle to display a map of the U.S. and write the state names on the map. You can learn more about turtle from [this tutorial].

â€¢  Pandas: Pandas is a Python module that provides tools for data manipulation and analysis, such as reading and writing CSV files, creating data frames, and performing operations on data. The game used pandas to read the data from a CSV file that contains the state names and their coordinates on the map. You can learn more about pandas from [this tutorial].
## Documentation
a list of relevant documentation for the technologies you mentioned. Here are some links that you might find useful:

â€¢  Python documentation: This is the official documentation for Python, a popular programming language that can be used for various purposes, such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and game development. You can find tutorials, reference guides, FAQs, and more on the official Python website.https://www.python.org/doc/

â€¢  Turtle documentation: This is the official documentation for turtle, a Python module that provides a graphical interface for drawing shapes and animations using a virtual turtle. You can learn how to use turtle graphics, an implementation of the popular geometric drawing tools from Logo, with examples and parameters. See how to draw shapes, move, rotate, turn, and set the orientation of the turtle with different modes and functions.https://docs.python.org/

â€¢  Pandas documentation: This is the official documentation for pandas, a Python module that provides tools for data manipulation and analysis, such as reading and writing CSV files, creating data frames, and performing operations on data. You can learn how to use pandas, an open source library for data analysis and data structures in Python. 
## Lessons Learned
Some of the lessons learnt by doing such a project relevant to the game and technologies used are:

â€¢  How to use Python, a popular programming language that can be used for various purposes, such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and game development. You can learn more about Python from [this tutorial].

â€¢  How to use turtle, a Python module that provides a graphical interface for drawing shapes and animations using a virtual turtle.

â€¢  How to use pandas, a Python module that provides tools for data manipulation and analysis, such as reading and writing CSV files, creating data frames, and performing operations on data. You can learn how to use pandas, an open source library for data analysis and data structures in Python. Find the user guide, API reference, developer guide and more on the official site of pandas documentation. You can learn more about pandas from [this tutorial].

â€¢  How to create a simple and interactive game using turtle and pandas. You can learn how to use the screen, turtle, and textinput methods to display a map of the U.S. and ask the user to guess the names of the 50 states. You can also learn how to use the data frame, loc, and item methods to access the data from a CSV file that contains the state names and their coordinates on the map. You can also learn how to use the goto and write methods to write the state names on the map at the corresponding coordinates, and update the title of the screen with the number of correct guesses. You can also learn how to use the break statement to exit the loop and create a new CSV file that contains the names of the states that the user did not guess, which can be used for learning.

â€¢  How to improve your coding skills, logic, and creativity by solving problems, debugging errors, and adding features to your game. You can learn how to use indentation, syntax, variables, loops, conditions, and functions to write clear and efficient code. You can also learn how to use online resources, documentation, and tutorials to find solutions and learn new concepts. You can also learn how to use your imagination and innovation to make your game more fun and engaging.
